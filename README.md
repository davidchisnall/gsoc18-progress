# Porting .NET Core and PowerShell to FreeBSD
## Tracking the progress

### What is this?

In this repository, I'll post documentation on the progress of the effort to port .NET Core and PowerShell to the FreeBSD operating system. The information here is supposed to be really detailed and technical, so bear with me :)

### Why?

This project is being developed under the Google Summer of Code program. I had this project accepted and am working on it over the summer -- or winter here in the south hemisphere. If you'd like to know more about it, check it out over [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5048087232380928).
